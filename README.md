# passwordgenerator

This password generator was designed to generate random passwords consisting of 8-128 characters. To increase durability, the passwords can incorporate an array of characters, including capital and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Consideration was given such that the passwords would require at least one type of character specification from the user in order to generate.
